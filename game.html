                <p>Vanessa Lazer graduated from Harvard at 16-years-old with a PhD in Particle Physics. She became interested in testing Einstein's theory on time and space after she became the lead engineer in the Cambridge lab in experimental physics. Vanessa was soon making breakthroughs, especially with her new programming genius, Austin, by her side. And she soon designed theoretical devices that could be used for time traveling. As word spread of this amazing invention, the intelligence community became very interested. Soon, spies were tapping the lab and plotting to steal any prototype. All the biggest world powers wanted to have exclusive control over time travel. As the years unfolded, her colleagues begged her not to continue. Vanessa saw her work as too important and refused. Click on the Vanessa button to play with her and find out what comes next in this great time travel adventure...</p>

                <p>Austin Snow is often criticized by his peers as being out of his class. From meager upbringings, Austin was a country boy that grew up on a farm in Arkansas. He was always scrawny and wasn't very good as a farm hand, so when he started to show exceptional skills at school, his father took the family savings and bought Austin a Tandy 1000 computer. It would change his life forever. Although Austin never went to college, by the time he was 20-years-old, he was working as lead engineer for the software development team at Macintosh. Steve Jobs saw his genius and eventually told him that he should go work for a greater cause to humanity. Having his pick of the litter, Austin sought out Vanessa and her fledgling time travel project. It was struggling due to a lack of software that could handle the speed of calculations. Over they years, Austin had brush-ins with shady spies, but he always stayed by Vanessa's side. Mainly out of his secret love for her. Play with Austin and see what happens next...</p>
